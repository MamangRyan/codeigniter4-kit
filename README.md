# CodeIgniter 4 Starter Kit

To me who uses Laravel a lot, it is really painful to find a good starter kit
for a new project. Laravel does a lot of starting points and because there are
visibly none for CodeIgniter, I decided to create a starter kit for CodeIgniter.

This starter kit is a mix with Laravel-like project, with the Laravel's
starting packages, so hopefully this starter kit has a good value. Any PRs
regarding improvement to the starting kit is welcome.

To-do:
- [ ] Basic Authentication

The package includes:
- Laravel mix (to mimic Laravel's asset compiling)
- TailwindCSS w/ DaisyUI (you can remove DaisyUI if you prefer to use plain TailwindCSS)
- AlpineJS
- ChartJS
- jQuery
- Simplelightbox
- Sweetalert2

## Getting started
- Clone this project.
- Run `composer install`.
- Run `npm install`.
- Run `npm run dev` or `npm run watch` to compile assets.
